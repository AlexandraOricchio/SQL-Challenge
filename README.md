# SQL-Challenge

I have been assigned my first research project as the new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. My task is to research employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files. As part of this assignment, I will design tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions regarding the data. In order to accomplish my first assignment I will perform: Data Modeling, Data Engineering, and Data Analysis. 


#### Repository Structure
Inside the EmployeeSQL folder you will find the following:
- **data** folder: contains the CSV files of raw data
- **output** folder: contains png files of visualizations created in the bonus notebook 
- **Bonus_notebook**: jupyter lab notebook with further data analysis and corresponding visualizations
- **ERD**: png file of the Entity-Relationship diagram that represents the data modeling process
- **employee_schema**: sql file of database schema represents the data engineering process
- **employee_queries**: sql file of all queries executed to complete the data analysis process
