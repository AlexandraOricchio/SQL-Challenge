# SQL-Challenge

I have been assigned my first research project as the new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. My task is to research employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files. As part of this assignment, I will design tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions regarding the data. In order to accomplish my first assignment I will perform: Data Modeling, Data Engineering, and Data Analysis.
